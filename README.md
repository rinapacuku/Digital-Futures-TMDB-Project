# TMDB Data Analysis Project

This repository contains a data analytics project analysing movie data from The TMDB Movie Database.

## Project Overview
This project focuses on extracting, cleaning, and analysing movie data to identify trends and patterns within the TMDB dataset. The aim was to apply core data analytics skills across the full workflow, from data preparation to exploratory analysis and interpretation.

## Methods and Tools
Rina Pacuku independently completed all stages of this project, applying the following data analytics techniques:

- **Data cleaning:** Missing values, inconsistencies, and irrelevant features were identified and handled.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Python and pandas were used to explore distributions, relationships, and trends within the data.
- **Feature analysis:** Key variables influencing movie performance were examined.
- **Visualisation:** Data visualisations were created to support insights and communicate findings clearly.
